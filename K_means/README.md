# Python k-means

[K-mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) clustering algorithm implementation in Python.

### Running the notebook

The code was written in Python across Jupyter notebooks. It was developed in Google Colab which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to run code through a browser.

# Samples

### Dataset

The training and testing datasets were taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), using the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

### Analysis

We have histograms for each training set attribute value:

We can also match the attributes of the training dataset:

Based on the previous image, we can observe a clearly separable class.

Iris-setosa is linearly separable from the other two classes; Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica are not linearly separable.
